# comp373-project3

**Project Overview:**

In this project by Emily Daly and Kelvin Bui, we will practice the implementation of design patterns. We created a clothing store system that shows the design and implementation of the Bridge pattern, Observer Pattern, and Visitor Pattern.


**Objectives:**
You need to design and implement:

  * Bridge Pattern
  * Observer Pattern
  * Visitor Pattern
        
In this system, the Bridge Patterns key functionality is being able to find each certain clothing department. 
The Observer Pattern sends customer emails for changes once an order has been made about their order status.
The Visitor Pattern prints out a comprehensive list of the customers order history or their most recent order.

**Project Expectation:**

   * Group executed project
   * Submission of Design and Code
